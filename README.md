## ✨ HairCLIP+ — AI-Powered Hairstyle Modification with CLIP and StyleGAN

**Hybrid Model | Text & Image Guided Edits | Coiffure Dataset**

### 📌 Project Overview

HairCLIP+ is a hybrid deep learning project that combines the power of **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)** and **StyleGAN2** to enable smart hairstyle transformations. Users can upload a photo and either:

* Select from **reference hairstyle images**
* Describe their desired style, color, or length in **natural language**
* Or use both (text + image) to guide the edit.

The model then generates a realistic image of the user with the new hairstyle using **StyleGAN** while understanding user intent through **CLIP** embeddings.

### 🔧 Key Features

* 🔀 **Hybrid CLIP + StyleGAN Architecture**
  Uses CLIP for understanding visual/textual hairstyle prompts and StyleGAN for generating modifications.

* 🧠 **Text & Image-Based Guidance**
  Modify hairstyles by entering descriptions like “blonde short curls” or selecting a visual reference image.

* 🎨 **Hair Style, Color, and Length Options**
  Users are shown 3–5 reference options for each (style, color, length), with selectable previews.

* 📸 **Selfie-Based Uploads**
  Upload a selfie (not real-time) and apply modifications interactively.

* 💾 **Model Export in H5 and TFLite**
  The final model can be exported for mobile or web integration.

* 📊 **Training on Coiffure Dataset**
  Trained and fine-tuned using the publicly available **Coiffure** hairstyle dataset for diverse styling.

### 🚀 How It Works

1. User uploads a selfie
2. System shows reference hairstyles (style, color, length)
3. User selects reference or enters text description
4. CLIP extracts features → StyleGAN generates new image
5. Final output is shown and saved locally

### 🧪 Sample Prompts You Can Try

* “Curly red hair, shoulder length”
* Select an image of a spiky blonde hairstyle
* Combine: upload a reference image + type “add red tint”

### 📦 Output Examples

* Realistic generated transformations with diverse hairstyles
* Image grid showing before/after and reference inspiration
